	 * This problem can be solved with a binary search.

For every row do the binary search to find exact position of the fist negative element, after that all elements are negative. 
Optimization here - for every next row the right limit for the binary search can be the index of the first negative from the previous row. 
This is due to fact that cols are also sorted so for the same column for every negative element the element below can be only negative. 
Thus we can exclude it from the binary search on the next step.

Also taking care of the edge cases helps - if first element is < 0 then all elements in a row are negative, if last one is non-negative then all elements are non-negative.

O(rows x lg(cols)) time - need to do lg(cols) binary search for each of rows row, O(1) space - no extra space other than few variables.
